# Module-3-Data-Analysis-using-Power-BI
In this project, I performed a detailed analysis of a dataset containing financial information, employing a variety of visualization tools to present the findings effectively. To convey key metrics succinctly, I created card charts that highlight essential figures such as total sales and total profit. These card charts serve as quick reference points for understanding the overall financial performance.

In addition to the card charts, I utilized stacked bar charts and pie charts to offer a more nuanced view of the data. Stacked bar charts were designed to illustrate the distribution of sales across different categories or periods, enabling comparative analysis. Pie charts were used to depict the proportions of various financial components, providing a clear picture of their relative contributions.

To facilitate a deeper dive into the financial performance, I included three table charts. These tables present a detailed breakdown of the data, allowing for a more granular examination of various performance metrics and trends.

Additionally, I have attached a video in the repository that demonstrates the interactive features of the analysis. The video shows how users can navigate between different pages and explore various insights by clicking on interactive buttons, enhancing the overall usability and engagement with the data.
